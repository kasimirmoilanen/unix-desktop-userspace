This is a repository that includes UNIX desktop userspace programs and configuration files that are customized to my personal taste and needs.
dwm+dmenu+st with dark solarized theme. slock for locking the screen.

TODO:
- Add dotfiles (.tmux.conf, init.vim...)
- Implement dark/light theme switch for entire desktop (not just st)
